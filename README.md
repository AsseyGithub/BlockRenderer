### Installation

We make use of custom yarn mappings to reduce patch size.

You can generate these mappings
via [mcp2yarn @ fabd47d](https://github.com/AterAnimAvis/mcp2yarn/tree/fabd47d4bc2797d29c01497b8f46365634381866)

Clone mcp2yarn and then run `gradle install` to generate and install the mappings to your local maven repository
